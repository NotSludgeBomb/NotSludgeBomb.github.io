Hello, I'm NotSludgeBomb (emphasis on the "Not", people tend to just call me "SludgeBomb" or "Sludge").
I'm an open source software developer and Linux user, and I enjoy talking about both of those things.
I also enjoy video games and speedcubing, though I don't discuss those as much, as Tux has taken over my mind.
One of my main focuses in my discussions is Linux's approachability as an operating system, 
and how we can make it easier for newcomers.

I'm a massive sl\*t for Flatpak, Wayland, and GNOME. Proponent of Fedora Linux (though I don't use it
myself because I'm nerdass).
