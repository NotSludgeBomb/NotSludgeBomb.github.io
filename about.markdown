Hello, I'm NotSludgeBomb (emphasis on the "Not", people tend to just call me "SludgeBomb" or "Sludge").
I'm an open source software developer and Linux user. I use this blog to talk about Linxu and open
source software. One of my main focuses is Linux's approachability as an operating system, and how we 
can make it easier for newcomers.

I'm a massive sl\*t for Flatpak, Wayland, GNOME, and Fedora Linux. Anti-sl\*t for Snaps, x11, and
KDE Plasma.
